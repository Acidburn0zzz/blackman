blackman tool
-------------
    Small package manager which download, compile -if needed- and install packages from sources.

    This tool has several goals in mind:
        1. It does not depend on repository.
        2. Be always up to date, since packages builds from the very last PKGBUILD in master BlackArch branch.
        3. Download from tool source.
        4. Compile the package.
